IMPORTANT: You need to split templates.html into 8 separate files:

Open templates.html and look for these sections:

1. Lines starting with <!-- bracket.html --> 
   Copy that entire section → Save as bracket.html

2. Lines starting with <!-- register.html -->
   Copy that entire section → Save as register.html

3. Lines starting with <!-- tournament.html -->
   Copy that entire section → Save as tournament.html

4. Lines starting with <!-- event.html -->
   Copy that entire section → Save as event.html

5. Lines starting with <!-- league.html -->
   Copy that entire section → Save as league.html

6. Lines starting with <!-- standings.html -->
   Copy that entire section → Save as standings.html

7. Lines starting with <!-- schedule.html -->
   Copy that entire section → Save as schedule.html

8. Lines starting with <!-- live-match.html -->
   Copy that entire section → Save as live-match.html

Each section is a complete HTML file - just copy and save separately!
