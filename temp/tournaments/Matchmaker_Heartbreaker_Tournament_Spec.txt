MATCHMAKER, HEARTBREAKER — TOURNAMENT FORMAT SPECIFICATION

Overview

Matchmaker, Heartbreaker is a Valentine’s-themed mixed doubles darts
tournament designed to combine a lighthearted winners bracket with a
chaotic, dynamic losers bracket. The format intentionally allows teams
to be created, dissolved, and re-formed during the event in a controlled
but unpredictable way.

The goal is to: - Allow couples and solo players to participate
equally - Encourage social interaction and drama-free chaos - Maintain
tournament flow despite partner changes - Preserve fairness while
embracing randomness

This document defines the rules, logic, and edge cases that the
tournament system and scorer must support.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Signup & Team Formation

Signup Types: 1. Couple Signup - Two players register together -
Initially treated as a locked team 2. Solo Signup - Player enters the
Matchmaker Pool - Will be randomly paired with an opposite-gender solo
player

Important: - Players do NOT need to come with a partner - The system
must clearly communicate this during signup and on the flyer - Couples
have no immunity from later re-pairing

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bracket Structure

WINNERS BRACKET - Game Type: Cricket - Format: Best-of-3 - Tone:
Lighthearted, cooperative, “love can flourish” - Teams remain intact
while in winners - No Heartbreaker actions occur here

LOSERS BRACKET - Game Type: 501 - Format: Best-of-1 - Tone: Chaotic,
unpredictable, high stakes - This is where Heartbreaker rules apply

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Heartbreaker Rule

Trigger Condition: - A team loses a match and enters the losers bracket

Heartbreaker Opt-In: - Either partner may anonymously opt into the
Heartbreaker - Only ONE opt-in is required to trigger eligibility - No
mutual consent is required - The other partner is NOT notified

Effects: - The team becomes eligible to be broken up - Re-pairing is not
guaranteed - Players may: - Be split and paired with new partners -
Remain together due to availability or random draw - Players only find
out when teams are announced for the next round

Key Principles: - Anonymity is absolute - The system must never reveal
who triggered the Heartbreaker - Messaging must always attribute
outcomes to randomness and availability

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Matchmaker Pool Logic

Matchmaker Pool contains: - Solo players - Heartbreaker-eligible players
awaiting re-pairing

Pairing Rules: - Only opposite-gender pairings allowed - Random
selection - The system may attempt to avoid immediate re-pairing of the
same team, but this is not guaranteed or promised

Director Controls: - Open / close pool - Run “Cupid Shuffle” (pairing
action) - Lock pairings before round play

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Messaging & UX Rules

Public-Facing: - Counts only (number of men / women in pool) - Pool open
/ closed status - No names or personal data

Private / System: - Track opt-ins, pairing history, and team IDs - Never
expose who opted into Heartbreaker

Language Standards: - Never say “your partner chose to switch” - Always
frame outcomes as: “random draw” “availability” “matchmaker results”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edge Cases

-   Uneven gender counts:
    -   Some players may temporarily remain with original partner
-   Multiple Heartbreaker opt-ins:
    -   Process in batches when pairing runs
-   Couples:
    -   Treated exactly the same as all other teams
-   Late arrivals:
    -   Added to waitlist or pool at director discretion

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design Intent

The event is intentionally unorthodox but must remain: - Predictable in
rules - Unpredictable in outcomes - Fair in opportunity - Fun in
execution

Tagline Logic: - Winners bracket = love, teamwork, stability - Losers
bracket = chaos, re-pairing, revenge potential

Key Messaging: “Love can flourish… but couples aren’t safe. Revenge is
possible. Chaos is encouraged.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation Notes for Scorer & Generator

The system must support: - Dynamic team reassignment mid-tournament -
Bracket continuity despite partner changes - Team identity changes
without breaking match history - Stateless game handling (each match
stands alone) - Director override controls

This format is designed to be robust under real-world bar conditions,
including late players, uneven pools, and spontaneous decisions.
