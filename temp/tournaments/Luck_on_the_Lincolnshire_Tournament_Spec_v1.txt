TOURNAMENT SPEC — “LUCK ON THE LINCOLNSHIRE” (PUB EVENT)
Version: v1.0
Last updated: 2026-01-22

====================================================================
1) OVERVIEW
====================================================================
Event Name:
- Luck on the Lincolnshire

Theme / Positioning:
- St. Patrick’s Day pub darts special using a Lincolnshire-inspired scoring variant
- House-bar event (NOT marketed as an “Open” / destination tournament)

Core Hook (one sentence):
- 401 Double-In / Double-Out across multiple events, played on standard boards with modified Lincolnshire-style scoring (triples treated as singles; bull values adjusted).

Primary Goals:
- Run a high-participation, low-stress tournament day at a familiar venue
- Keep matches moving with predictable timing
- Make the format feel special without requiring physical board modification

====================================================================
2) DATE, VENUE, BOARDS
====================================================================
Date:
- Saturday, March 7

Venue:
- Regular BRDC bar venue (insert exact name/address)

Boards:
- 10 steel-tip boards available

Recommended Floor Plan Notes:
- Post the rules at each board (table tent or wall sign)
- Assign a “control table” near boards for bracket sheets, check-in, and payouts
- Ensure score sheets / tablets are available and a pen cup per board

====================================================================
3) MASTER RUN-OF-SHOW (STRESS-FREE TIMING)
====================================================================
High-level schedule (director-safe):
- 2:00 PM  — Doors / check-in opens (warmup boards available)
- 2:30 PM  — Triples event begins (hard start)
- 3:45 PM  — Buffer window (food, late arrivals, reset, post singles brackets)
- 5:30 PM  — Singles block begins (men’s + ladies running in parallel)
- ~8:00 PM — Doubles block (if held) OR begin Blind Draw earlier if desired
- ~9:15 PM — Blind Draw block (recommended as “night capper”)
- ~10:45–11:00 PM — Target finish

Why the buffer matters:
- Prevents the day from “bleeding” into a midnight finish
- Lets players arrive in waves and still get a clean start to singles

====================================================================
4) EVENTS (MENU)
====================================================================
Planned events (based on discussion):
A) Triples (opening event)
B) Men’s Singles
C) Ladies Singles
D) Men’s Doubles (if participation supports)
E) Women’s Doubles (if participation supports)
F) Blind Draw Doubles (end-of-night social event)

Notes:
- If turnout is high, keep optional doubles events capped or single-elim only.
- If turnout is lower, you can expand doubles participation without risking time.

====================================================================
5) UNIVERSAL GAME FORMAT (APPLIES TO ALL EVENTS)
====================================================================
Game:
- 401

In/Out:
- Double In / Double Out (DIDO)

Match length:
- Best of 3 legs for all rounds
- Finals: Best of 5 legs (recommended for Men’s Singles + Ladies Singles finals)
  (Optionally keep BO3 finals if time is tight.)

Cork / start:
- Standard cork procedure (winner starts leg 1; alternate starts thereafter or per house rule)
- If you prefer: winner of cork starts leg 1, then alternate start each leg

====================================================================
6) LINCOLNSHIRE-STYLE MODIFIED SCORING (STANDARD BOARDS)
====================================================================
Purpose:
- Simulate the “missing triples / altered bull” Lincolnshire vibe without altering boards physically.

SCORING RULES (LOCKED)
1) Triples score as Singles
- Any dart landing in a triple segment scores the SINGLE value of that number.
  Example: T20 counts as 20 (NOT 60)

2) Doubles score normally
- Doubles remain standard (D20 = 40, etc.)

3) Bull values adjusted
- Inner bull (bullseye) = 50
- Outer bull = 10

4) Singles and misses are standard
- Singles score face value
- Miss / bounce-out = 0

Why this works:
- Removes “power scoring” without confusing tape jobs
- Keeps games closer and more strategic
- Makes bull useful but not dominant

Posting requirement:
- Print a simple rules card for EVERY board:
  “Triples = Singles • Bull 50/10 • 401 DIDO • BO3 (Final BO5)”

====================================================================
7) EVENT STRUCTURES (RECOMMENDED)
====================================================================

- HARD CAP recommendation: 8 teams (to protect the day)

====================================================================
8) TIMING MODEL + CONTROLS (KEEP IT MOVING)
====================================================================
Pacing reality with 401 DIDO + modified scoring:
- Average leg: 8–11 minutes
- Average BO3 match: 22–30 minutes
Director planning cap:
- Use a planning number of 25 minutes per match

Two director rules that save the entire night:
1) No practice once match is called
- Warmup is only before the round begins or while waiting to be called.

2) Match time cap protocol (only if needed)
- If a match reaches 25 minutes, the next leg becomes “sudden death”:
  - First player/team to check out on any double wins the leg and match.
(You’ll rarely invoke this; its existence prevents drift.)

Board usage math:
- 10 boards allow 10 matches to run concurrently.
- Early rounds consume boards; later rounds naturally free boards for finals.

====================================================================
9) CHECK-IN, ENTRY, SEEDING (DIRECTOR NOTES)
====================================================================
Check-in window:
- Opens at 2:00 PM
- Close Triples registration at 2:30 PM (hard start)

Suggested process:
- Players sign in at control table
- Collect fees, confirm event(s) entered, assign to bracket(s)
- Post bracket sheets clearly and announce board assignments

Seeding:
- If you want “house-friendly fairness,” random draw is fine.
- If you want slightly more competitive balance, do light seeding for top locals.

Entry fees / payouts:
- Not finalized in chat (insert your numbers)
- Recommendation: Clearly separate payout pools per event.

====================================================================
10) MATCH PROCEDURES (STANDARDIZATION)
====================================================================
Call-up:
- Announce match + board number
- Players have 2 minutes to report

Cork:
- Standard cork procedure. Re-throw ties.

Scoring:
- Use a designated scorekeeper or agreed scorer per match.
- Confirm the modified scoring rules at the start of each match:
  Triples = singles, bull = 50/10.

Disputes:
- If a dart value is questioned:
  - Pause scoring
  - Call director
  - Director decision is final

Sportsmanship:
- Pub energy encouraged; keep it respectful
- No excessive delays at the oche

====================================================================
11) SIGNAGE / PLAYER COMMUNICATION
====================================================================
Minimum signage at every board:
- “401 DIDO • BO3 (Final BO5) • Triples=Singles • Bull 50/10”

Control table sign:
- Full rules + schedule + “hard start times”

Suggested short explainer (for socials / flyer):
- “Old-school pub darts: 401 Double-In/Double-Out with Lincolnshire-style scoring (triples count as singles; bull 50/10).”

====================================================================
12) STAFFING + ROLES (SMOOTH OPERATION)
====================================================================
Minimum recommended roles:
- Tournament Director (final calls, bracket flow, board assignments)
- Check-in / Cash handler (can be same as TD if needed, but better separate early)
- Floater / Board runner (calls matches, confirms board availability)
Optional:
- Dedicated scorekeepers for late rounds

====================================================================
13) MATERIALS CHECKLIST
====================================================================
Required:
- Bracket sheets (printed) OR laptop/tablet for bracket management
- Pens/markers, clipboard(s)
- Rules cards (10+ copies, one per board)
- Board assignment cards (optional but helpful)
- Cash box / digital payment option
- Tape for posting brackets
- Timer/phone (match cap awareness)

Nice-to-have:
- TV slide with schedule + rules
- Small table tents with rules for each board

====================================================================
14) CONTINGENCIES (IF TURNOUT CHANGES)
====================================================================
If Men’s Singles exceeds 30:
- Keep BO3 throughout until finals
- Enforce “no practice after call” strictly
- Consider BO3 finals if time becomes critical

If Ladies Singles exceeds 15:
- Keep single-elim BO3
- Run more in parallel during men’s early rounds

If Triples participation exceeds cap:
- Either create a waitlist OR add a second, later Triples “mini” event only if schedule allows.
- Do NOT let Triples push into the singles block.

If boards become unavailable:
- Prioritize singles events first
- Move optional doubles to later or reduce to single-elim BO1 legs only (last resort)
