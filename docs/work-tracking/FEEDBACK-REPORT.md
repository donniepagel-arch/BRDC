**Message:**
> Error saving: can't find variable: out rule.
> Also need to change how quick out selection works. Now it makes its own box and says the remaining number, this is incorrect. Instead it should how three darts in the calculation box on the 501 scorer. The player will then touch which dart they hit the out on. The left dart for first dart, middle dart for second shot and right dart for hitting the double on the 3rd dart.
>
> If the rule is select starter it should ask who starts in the prescorer pop up and not on the game setup page.  It should also ask every leg.  I also want to see leg by leg stats at set completion.

Vertically a circle for each chat room the player is in with a little number for how many updates in the chat since they've been in. When you click them it goes to that room in the chat.  The circle that expand out horizontally would be the player to player messenger chats. The circles could be the avatar for the player and they'll also have little number for how many updates in each chat since opened.  Once clicked it can expand up into the messenger. If there is a chat with multiple people it can over lap the group of circles on each other.
